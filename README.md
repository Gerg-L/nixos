This is my personal nixos configuration
it currently has 2 hosts:

  "gerg-desktop" my main computer [specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Mhyrfv)
  which I run a windows KVM VFIO virtual machine on
  
  "game-laptop" a HP Pavilion Laptop [15-ec2121nr](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07918617#AbT0)
  which I've been testing linux game compatability on
