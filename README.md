  "gerg-desktop" my main computer [specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/DVkMk9)
  which I run a windows KVM VFIO virtual machine on
  
  "game-laptop" a HP Pavilion Laptop [15-ec2121nr](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07918617#AbT0)
  which I've been testing linux game compatability on
  
  "moms-laptop" a TOSHIBA Satellite [L855-S5309](https://fo-stage-03.icecat.biz/us/p/toshiba/pskfuu-008049/satellite-notebooks-l855-s5309-18316794.html)
